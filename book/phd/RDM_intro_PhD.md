# Reseach Data Management introduction for PhD candidates
Research data management is an important part of your PhD research. It helps keeps your data safe, makes your work more reproducible, and ensures you comply with university and funder [policies](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies).
 
## Requirements for PhD candidates:
- Develop a written data management plan (DMP) within the first 12 months of the PhD[^footnote1]
- Attend the relevant training in data management
- Ensure that all data and code underlying the completed PhD theses are FAIR (Findable, Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) by sharing in a research data repository, unless there are valid reasons not to[^footnote1]
  
## CEG faculty resources:
- Faculty data stewards (Lora Armstrong & Xinyan Fan; datasteward-CiTG@tudelft.nl) provide feedback on DMPs and answer questions about managing research data/software
- Training on writing a DMP is offered; invitations are sent by the data stewards to PhD candidates roughly 6-9 months after the start of the PhD
- More information about research data management for new CEG PhD candidates can be found in the next section
